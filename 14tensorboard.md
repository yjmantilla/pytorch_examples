# Tensorboard

- Install tensor board
- Start tensorboard before python code

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

Use 11MNIST_MultilayerNN.py with TENSORBOARD = True

runs directory must be the same as the one from the python code, so watch out that the terminal is at the same folder as the python code if using relative paths
